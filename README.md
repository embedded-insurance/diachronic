## Overview

Durable programs play through a recording of what's happened to determine what happens next.

This provides solutions to core issues in distributed computing while also giving software powerful new abilities.

Durable programs can continue from where they left off on another machine, model a long-lived process while consuming
minimal compute resources, or reset back to a previous step.

The catch is this only works for one version of a program. 

Diachronic solves this. 


## Status

Diachronic is used in production at Embedded Insurance.

We are working to open source the project and continue to develop the open source version.
